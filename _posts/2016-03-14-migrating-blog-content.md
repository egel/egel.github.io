Currently, I am in a phase of migrating my content from legacy Wordpress to
Pelican. To finally complete this, I have to translate all content from Polish
to English to reach further audience.

Unfortunately, at this moment I suffer for lack of free time. There are many
posts to process and it takes a lot of effort to update them for appropriate
level of well written article.

As soon as I finish transfer of my articles, I will post it here. By this
moment, I would like to invite you take a look on actual a list, you may find
something interesting here.

Thank you for your indulgence and stay tuned :)
