Each profession has some niche of people which manifest their skills to audience in noticeable way. Fortunate, there are many ways to manifest skills. Part of them are positive, some of them might suggest inappropriate behavior or skills to your team/collegues.

In this article I would like to analyze MHO how webdevelopment have a favorable behavior model/pattern. Furthermore I want dispute what kind of factors advocate, that a person is promising ProUser or when your attitude could suggest to the others an anti-programmer type.

Disclaimer: this topic is huge and the man could write a book about it. In this article I will try to emphasis some points which might be a bit different from the well known stereotype (intelligent, educated, fast typist, fast thinker). This topic will try answer the question how to discover some true potential even in a programming newbee.

## Let's start with positives

What could advocate for being promising/awesome programmer to the others? I will not take into consideration the skills (which are crucial to get the job), I will try to focus on behavior and character of each personality.

### Positive character

**Being patient** is an important skill and often underestimate by people. _Why?_ Being patient should be somehow written in the programmer's profession. Being a code writer is not like making up a novel where anything you will write don't need to make logic sens. Is more like a fight, where every single day you will make a battle against the logical structures of the code. On this battlefield, your enemy is **the code** and **the opinions of other people about your code** because in the end both things have to meet together.

For programmer there are many occasions in each day where you will have to deal with other people which won't share your opinion of accomplishing stuff and for this human interaction patient is the key (e.g.: famous Google first code review when most Google developer try to find anything wrong in your code). Being patient in this profession have a major foundation upon which you will build your digital career - without it burnout is guaranteed, it will be just a matter of time when it happen.

As I already mentioned, this type of job is almost all about analyzing and solving problems. So **being naturally curious** helps with daily tasks and reinforce the feeling in the eyes of others that you're the right person in the right place. Builtin curiosity and the strong need to learn new stuff, usually leads to the holly grail of programmers world, the solution.

**Open to constructive critique**. Being a programmer is not a fairy tale - it's difficult. There is a lot of hidden frustration or sometimes even rage about the code in the codebase (search for any infamous rage discussion in OpenSource projects). The high ability to talk about the code from perspective and being as much objective as possible, will in the end gives inner relax (and the teammates) which in the end is forged in the quality code. 

A need for **code reviews**, either an own code or the code of other people, should be high in good daily workflow. The reason for this is, the more code will be reviewed by programmer the more he learns. This also works in other direction, the more critique you get about your code the better you will be in future solutions. Primary, good programmer learn as much as possible from the others to not make those mistakes himself. Secondly, to write better code programmer must to being open minded and applying a constructive critique from the reviewers in his solutions.

### Good habits

**Keep It Stupid Simple** (or KISS for sort), this is without a doubt the central devise many programmers with well developed habits. E.g.: by keeping your code small and simple (small diffs) there will be a great chance, that your change will be soon accepted by the code reviewers and merged. Hence your job will be done sooner, the others will have a feeling you're more productive then the general average.

**Keeping an eye on the goal** - programmers tend to be like a capitan of pirate ship, they sail in various oceans of digital bits, but the goal changes along with the wind. This should not be like that. It's tempting carrier to be like the capitan of pirate ship, but often will lead to troubles. In some example scenario, it could exceed the estimated time for the issue to accomplish (if you follow agile) and in addition somebody waits for your solution in order to continue his work - this could leads to misunderstanding, frustration in team or working lately to deliver the feature. To omit this problems, try to be more like navigator on the ship, no matter what will surround you, by looking at the stars (i.e.: your knowledge) you will always find a way for yourself (and your crew) to get to the port. This will put more light on you as a leader of a group.

If you're a programmer and you've got the task which you know how to accomplish just after you've heard it - great it should be easy, right? Although, it's not always like that! Most of us, when getting some task, usually don't have a clue how they will finish it nor how much time they will need for this. However, **do not afraid to get out from your comfort zone** - it's important to go further because this is a part of our profession - uncertainty is high, but usually reward as well. Being a good programmer is to never being closed only in the solutions you already know, rather to be open on new unknown possibilities. This is power of true effective specialist.

**Programming is almost all about collaboration and sharing ideas or solutions**. If you don't believe me, this peace of electronic on which you're reading this article right. Now, think for a few seconds if this device (and the software) has been made by only one person? Definitely not! So this mean to be a good one you must be some sort a good team player, but it's not like this all the time. Although at some point programmer must also like a solo activity. With it he will spend most of the time. If I would summarize it in simple scale factor of 10 points - for me it's like 3-5:7-5. Depend on the type of task, 3 up to 5 points will be spend for team collaboration, analyzing the problems and precising the goals and the rest from 7 up to 5 points will go in the research and physical implementation.

Changing a bit the topic. **Drinking a lot of water**. This usually isn't even noticed by other people. For a second try to be 100% honest with yourself, how often have you noticed that your buddy at work drinking water instead of Coke or other soft drink? Possible 30-0% chance that you've noticed. Nevertheless, this simple habit of drinking water will have a significant meaning on you mood and general health. It's well known that sugar is some sort of "a legal drug" and it won't increase your thinking capabilities, rather the opposite. You will think that it gives you a boost but sweets will tell your brain to "feel good", but it's only a temporarily feeling. Pure water will boost your organism to correct and effective work in long range. So if you will see a programmer with a bottle of water and the same one with Coke you will know which one will be more effective in work.

### Physical

**Doing exercises**. I think I would not lie you if I would say that it's popular that IT guys (of any sort) are either fat nor thin like a stick. It's not always the true in XXI century. Many "office workers" follow the new health trends. But for many people which work in the office, is hard to resist the higher need of always having something sweet on the side. I think this case apply especially for programmers, where there is trend to provide all possible sweets or soft drinks in the office (aka Kitchen goodies, or something similar). Then the templation of not trying anything of that is really huge! But a "round" programmer is not bad programmer! Personally I know couple of really good programmers which are really big guys. Although, IMHO this has a deeper meaning. Some of them are overweight because (I'm not involving in it any illnesses nor disabilities) programmers tend to work in front of a desk for a long hours. Moreover, to be good programmer, usually the person have to learn a lot and cover this with practice, which usually mean that you have to spend even more time siting. While your code skill will rise, the same does your weight. This means truly effective programmer will also take care of his health by doing some activities in order to keep body (and the mind!) in good shape.

For some of you this also might be silly, but **good position while sitting** might tell if you're treating your job serious and you want to be the most effective as possible. People who have a good position while sitting in front of his computers have less health problems which mean they will be more compelling at work for longer range of time.

And don't get me wrong, being patient with being slow, clumsy because programmer should be also fast


### Gray area of programming

- no one can be always productive, happy, burst with energy... so the gray area it to recognize the burnout from just being tired.
