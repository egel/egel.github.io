title: Top 10 Sketch plugins for the first quarter of 2018
published: false

More-less one and the half year ago I started my journey with Sketch. For those of you which aren't familiar with Sketch - this is the program for rapid prototyping an advanced mockups for almost any desired device (i.e.: desktop, tablet, phone, watch, TV & more). 

Since while I've searched a tool that will allow me to quickly design robust mockups, which I can show to a larger audience of users and then gather some feedback (comments) regarding them. This amazing program saves me from oblivion a hundred times ever since. I could easily design even very complex and nested mockup with hundreds of auto updated components for clients or colleagues.

Now Iâ€™d like to share my top 10 plugins that I use for while sketching the new wires.
 
> To download plugins **always use some plugin manager** - I can recommend [Sketch Plugin Manager](https://mludowise.github.io/Sketch-Plugin-Manager/)

### My Top 10

Plugins are collected with alphabetical sort A-Z, so the order does not matter.

1. Clipboard fill
1. Content Generator
1. Craft - the plugin for Invision
1. Distributor 
1. Find Slice
1. Font Buddy
1. Icon Font
1. Segmented Circle
1. Sketch Palettes 
1. Symbol organizer

### Clipboard fill
This small plugin will help you with "copy & pasta" any kind of image from the web or even from default mac screenshot tool (like, drag and create screenshot: `cmd` + `Shift` + `4`)

### Content Generator

Just generator of quick images, names, strings, dummy texts and more. 

Very useful while designing initial mockups when real content like images/text is not so important to exactly match target domain.

### Craft

This plugin is directly combined with Invision app that allows the users to publish the mockups online and collaborate with them. 

The plugin itself provide a so easy solution to quickly upload selected/all **Artboards** online to the specific project in your Invision account.

IMHO, Craft is much useful than [InvisionSync app](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/an-all-new-invision-sync/) in larger projects for multiple files and many UX/UI designers which working on several parts at the same time. The Craft, apart of uploading selected artboards, allows us as well to upload elements/components that we would like additionally extract from mockups for all our users (i.e.: frontend developers) in order to be instantly available for building a real views/apps. 

For example, extracting an `icon-chair` (with clicking knife icon) and then they will be available into Invision's **assets tab** for this special mockup/artboard or available to download all of them once (with a blue button in the top right corner) - just like in the picture below. Awesome!!!
