title: Nginx configuration for AngularJS cloud project with Apiary
tags: [angularjs, nginx, apiary, frontend]
---

Recently I have been working on some cloud project with my coworkers. We used [AngularJS][angularjs-webpage] as frontend framework and [Apiary][apiary-webpage] as a backend bridge for RESTful API, while the real backend was being built.

The main goal for proper Nginx configuration was to serve `*.example.dev` domains, but with some exceptions (restrictions) for subdomains:

-   `www` subdomain as a legacy restriction
-   `api` subdomain reserved for final REST API
-   `tests` this subdomain (for my purpose only) provides easy URL to code coverage with
    unit tests

> I used `dev` domain only on my local machine. Feel free to change it to whatever name you like.

While building frontend application I have made some basic Nginx configuration and it looks like this snippet presented at the bottom.

> It might be important for Readers. We have decided to split application for two separate projects, due to AngularJS have problems with the support of multiple subdomains. Finally one of our application serve subdomains `<variable>.example.dev` and other serve basis domain `example.dev`.

This configuration provides 5 servers:

-   First one is for frontend application, which may support organizations with some exceptions for `api`, `tests` and `www` (ex.: `companyname.example.dev`).
-   Second for legacy domain `www` redirect.
-   The third is for frontend application which may support only basic domain (ex.: `example.dev`).
-   Next one is for REST backend domain redirect provided by apiary.
-   The Last one provides easy access to auto-generated code coverage for
    fronted app.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name ~^(?:(?!www)(?!api)(?!tests))(.*)\.example\.dev$;
  access_log /tmp/subdomains.example.dev.log;
  error_log  /tmp/subdomains.example.dev.error.log;

  client_max_body_size 100M;

  location / {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
    root '/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_WORKING_DIR/example-subdomain-frontend/build';
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name www.example.dev;
  return 301 $scheme://exampe.dev$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.dev;
  access_log /tmp/example.dev.log;
  error_log  /tmp/example.dev.error.log;

  client_max_body_size 100M;

  location / {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
    root '/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_WORKING_DIR/example-domain-frontend/build';
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name api.example.dev;

  access_log /tmp/api.example.dev.log;
  error_log  /tmp/api.example.dev.error.log;

  location / {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,X-CustomHeader,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type';

    proxy_pass http://private-ABCDE-example.apiary-mock.com;
  }
}


server {
  listen 80;
  server_name tests.example.dev;

  client_max_body_size 100M;

  root "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_WORKING_DIR/example-subdomain-frontend/tests/test-coverage/PhantomJS 2.1.1 (Mac OS X 0.0.0)";
}
