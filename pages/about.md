## About the author

Hello! My name is Maciej Sypie≈Ñ, and I'm a software engineer with great passion for web development (especially for the frontend, backend, UX/UI design, and mobile applications).
During work, I'm always trying to do my best. Furthermore, with enthusiasm and open mind, I search for or listen to other creative concepts.

I'm also involved in a few Open Source projects and among them are:

<div style="clear: both"></div>

-   [Tmux Gruvbox theme][github-egel-tmux-gruvbox],
-   [Personal dotfiles configurator][github-egel-dotfiles],
-   [UEK LaTeX Thesis Class][github-egel-uek-latex-thesis-class],
-   [Translations Manager][github-tr]

Although that's only a fragment of my efforts and not all of them I could openly expose.

If you've got some **interesting project propositions** or just **want to say _Hi_**, you can achieve it via **maciejsypien at gmail dot com**.<br/> I'm always happy to have a nice talk üôÇ.

However, if you prefer a **private channel**, feel free to send me an encrypted email by using my [public PGP key](http://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x10BC01EDA6827DC8). I am always double exited to read a nice, encrypted message. 

You can also find my keys manually in one of the public PGP servers: [PGP Public Key Server](https://pgp.key-server.io/), [OpenPGPkeyserver](http://keys.gnupg.net/) or [MIT PGP Public Key Server](https://pgp.mit.edu/).

My key fingerprint is:

```

This blog is also partly my career diary, so many decisions, things I've experienced and the reason why I made it that way, you will also find here.
